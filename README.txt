This is my control script emulating some of the functions of the Akai APC 40 
on any generic midi controller. 

The hope is that with a fairly basic understanding of python and how control 
scripts in Live work that anyone will be able to adapt or expand upon this script
to bring these functions to any midi controller.

This script has been updated for Python3 and Ableton Live 11!
